## jsonmsg Specification

### Terminology
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

### Overview
APIs MUST be specified using a `spec.json` that MUST validate against the jsonmsg [meta-schema](meta.json).
The `spec.json` itself is a JSON Schema as defined in [json-schema-core](http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-core.html).

The `spec.json` MUST be served via HTTP(S) to clients at the "endpoints.host" path.
This helps clients to inspect API functionality and generate source code.

### Endpoints
The "endpoints" section defines the overall location and supported protocols of an API.

#### Host
The "host" property MUST define an URI as defined in [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986) without the scheme part.
The scheme part SHOULD be generated by implementations based on the "protocols" and "tls" properties.

### Protocols
The "protocols" array MUST define at least one protocol the API supports.

Supported protocols SHOULD be of the following list:

| Protocol | Description |
|---|---|
| http | Messages MUST be POSTed to the HTTP(S) endpoint |
| websocket | Messages MUST be sent as message |

### TLS
The "tls" property MUST indicate whether the endpoints are available with Transport Layer Security as defined in [RFC 5246](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246).

### Messages
The "messages" section SHOULD define communication objects where the property name defines the message name and the value defines the message properties.
Message names SHOULD be in CamelCase and MUST only contain alphabet letters `[A-Za-z]`.

A valid message document MUST contain exactly two properties:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| msg | The message name as defined in the property name |
| data | Data conforming to either the referenced "in", or one of the "outs" schemas |

For example, a valid message can be:
```
{
  "msg": "fetchUser",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

#### Title
The "title" property MAY define a short description of the message.

#### Description
The "description" property MAY define a long description of the message.

#### In
If present, the "in" property MUST be a URI Reference to a JSON Schema.
The referenced schema defines the structure for the "data" property of a message.

If the property is absent, the message MUST not contain a "data" property.

#### Outs
If present, the entries in the "outs" array MUST be URI References to JSON Schemas.
The "data" property of a message responding to the initial message MUST conform to one of the referenced schemas.

If the property is absent, the initial message SHOULD not produce follow up messages.

#### Group
The "group" property MAY define a name to combine messages into groups.

### Definitions
The "definitions" section SHOULD define data objects that SHOULD be referenced by messages.
The contents are defined as specified in [json-schema-core](http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-core.html).

#### Data Messages
Each property name in the "definitions" section also defines a message name that SHOULD be used to send data messages.

For example, the definition:
```
{
  ...
  "definitions": {
    "user": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "id": { "type": "string" },
        "name": { "type": "string" }
       }
    }
  }
}
```
SHOULD generate a data message in the form:
```
{
  "msg": "user",
  "data": {
    "id": "...",
    "name": "..."
  }
}
```
